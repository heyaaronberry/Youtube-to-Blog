 Most automatic speech recognition services or ASR's are built on technology that's over fifty years old. The old tech is fine for short call and response audio, but it just doesn't work for conversational audio. We built an end to end deep learning neural network that delivers actually usable transcriptions that get even better over time at lightning speed without high hardware costs or high transcription costs.

Voice enabled experiences are a big deal in business these days. For good experience, you need a foundation of real time accurate transcription. But most automatic speech recognition services or ASR's are built on technology that's over fifty years old. Yep. Even these guys.

The old tech is fine for short call and response audio. Alexa. What's the weather today, But it just doesn't work for conversational audio. I'm having a problem with my super user service, this is what's happening. In order to make real use out of voice data, transcription needs to be accurate fast, cost effective, and scalable.
